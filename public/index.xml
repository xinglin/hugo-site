      <description>Along with Ford Prefect, Dent barely escapes the Earth&amp;rsquo;s destruction as it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle.
 He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy.
 In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich-maker.</description>

      <description>There are some papers that are so well written that I really enjoyed reading them. Here is a list of them.
 BlueCache: A Scalable Distributed Flash-based Key-value Store
The system design is very clear from the paper. Learned a lot about its index and data store part.
 What&amp;rsquo;s Really New with NewSQL?
Provides a historial view of how we enter into NewSQL and did an excellent survey of state-of-art NewSQL Databases</description>

      <title>NV-Tree: Reducing Consistency Cost for NVM-based Single Level Systems</title>

      <description>This paper introduces a new B+ tree variation that is optimized for NVM by reducing consistency cost from memory fence and cacheline flush operations.
 Consistency is guaranteed only for leaf nodes. Internal nodes are re-built from leaf nodes. Elements in leaf nodes are not sorted. A log-structure is used for leaf nodes to remove the need for frequent synchronization. Only appends are added to a leaf node. This also increases concurrency.</description>

      <description>With this theme, it is possible to add small sections that only contains one page like this. It will automatically appears in the header, at the end.

      <description>In this theme, it is possible to add sections like a Projects one for example. You can add plenty of articles about your projects and a presentation page that will be displayed before the list. All is modulable, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want something.
A Hollywood-funded film version, produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005.</description>

      <title>Reflection After Dissertation Defense</title>

      <description>After six years in the PhD program, since August 2009, I finally defended my dissertation today. I feel grateful that I finally make it. I do think I am one of the luck ones: I have a really nice adviser and he gives me strong support to do research in areas which I am interested in. I feel grateful for all the help I have received from my advisor, committee members, office mates and co-workers.</description>

      <title>Sketch Data Structures</title>

      <description>Tonight, I went to attend a local meetup event. The talk was given by a faculty from my own department, Jeff Phillips, an assistant professor working in the area of big data analysis. The topic of his talk is about sketch data structure - data structures which uses a much smaller amount of memory to summarize the represented data.This is a cool technique and I am very interested to learn more.</description>

      <description>List storage pools
virsh pool-list --details
 List all volumes for a pool
vol-list --details POOLNAME
 To create a Qemu guest with a image in qcow2 format, we need to first create a storage pool first.
virsh pool-define-as --name qcow2 --type dir --target /mnt/qemu-img
virsh pool-start qcow2
 To create a Qemu guest with bridged network
sudo virt-install -n vm1 -r 1024 --disk path=/mnt/qemu-imgs/vm1.qcow2,bus=virtio,size=5,format=qcow2 -c /mnt/sda4/ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso --network bridge=virbr0 --graphics vnc,listen=0.</description>

      <description>I did my PhD proposal denfense yesterday and now I am one more step closer to finish it. It took a week to just prepare the talk. The talk was long and have 45 slides. However, there are only about 8 slides for each project, since there are 4 projects. The talk lasts about 45 minutes. Because it is so long, everytime I practiced it, I almost lost my voice after I finished.</description>

      <title>Clone a Single KVM/qemu Virtual Machine</title>

      <description>I am working on virtual machine cloning for security testing for the TCloud project. We are looking for an efficient and transparent virtual machine cloning technique that has minimal impact on the virtual machine to be cloned. After some investigation, we found that KVM supports live snapshot for both memory and disk state while Xen4.4 currently does not support this feature yet but could be patched to do live snapshot for memory state easily.</description>

      <title>Trade-off Between Accuracy and Runtime Overhead</title>

      <description>During the weekly technical forum within the NetApp ATG group, a team member presented the trip report for OSDI &amp;lsquo;14 this year. In his talk, he mentioned a paper that pushed me to think more in this line. The paper is about how to estimate the working set of a workload, using less memory and runs much faster. The only related work that dealt with the same problem was proposed more than 10 years ago and in that work, the authors tried to get the exact working set size, with a very high demand for memory and runtime.</description>
