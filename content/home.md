Hey ! Welcome to my page. I have completed my PhD study and now work as a researcher at NetApp. 
I am interested in the following areas: data deduplication, compression, distributed storage, solid state drives, key-value stores, big data analytic frameworks, and databases. On some day in the future, I think I will start to look at AI/ML frameworks.
