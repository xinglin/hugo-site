Hey ! Welcome to my page. I have completed my PhD study and now work as a researcher at NetApp. 
I am interested in the following areas: data deduplication, compression, distributed storage, solid state drives, and key-value stores. 

In my spare time, I like reading books (especially in history), hiking around in the local area, and nice food.
