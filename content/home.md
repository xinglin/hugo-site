Hey ! Welcome to my page. I have completed my PhD study and now work as a researcher at NetApp. 
I am interested in the following areas: data deduplication, compression, distributed storage, solid state drives, key-value stores, big data analytic frameworks, and databases. On some day in the future, I think I will start to look at AI/ML frameworks.  

In my spare time, I like reading books (especially in history), hiking around in the local area, and nice food.
