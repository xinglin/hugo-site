Welcome to my page. My name is Xing Lin. 
I have completed my PhD study with a focus on improving performance and storage efficiency for storage systems. 
I have worked as a researcher at NetApp since 2015. 
I am interested in the following areas: data deduplication, compression, distributed storage, solid state drives, and key-value stores. 

In my spare time, I like reading books (especially in history), hiking around in the local area, and nice food. 

> The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes.     -- Peter Norvig


> We choose to go to the Moon! Not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.   --John F. Kennedy
