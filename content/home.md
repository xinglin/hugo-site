Test5..
Hi, my name is Xing Lin. I am a big data infrastructure engineer at Linkedin since 2021.
Before that, I worked as a research software engineer 
for 5+ years in the advanced technology group at NetApp.
Before that, I was a PHD student in the school of computing at the University of Utah. 
My advisor is Prof. [Robert Ricci][ricci]. 
I also did two internships with [Fred Douglis][fred] at the Advanced Development Team, EMC Backup and Recovery System Division and one internship with 
[Gokul Soundararajan][gokul] and Jingxin Feng at the Advanced Technology Group, NetApp.
Even before that, I completed my Bachelor from the College of Software, Nankai University, China in 2009.
I am interested in the following areas: big data systems, data deduplication, compression, distributed storage, solid state drives, and key-value stores.
</p>

In my spare time, I like reading books (especially history and biography), hiking around in the local area, and sampling nice food. 

> The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes.     -- Peter Norvig


> We choose to go to the Moon! Not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.   --John F. Kennedy
