The story started with an internship at NetApp Advanced Technology Group in 2014. 
After the internship, I received a return offer from them. 
At that time, ATG has roughly 50 engineers. 
I also got an offer from the advanced development team (ADT) in the backup and 
recovery system (BRS) division in EMC. The BRS ADT has a dozen members, 
5~6 members at Irvine, 4~5 at Princeton, only 1 member at Santa Clara. 
The BRS ADT team primarily focuses on backup systems while ATG's scope is 
more broad, given that ATG is part of the corporate-level CTO office in NetApp. 
I further reasoned that even if both my two mentors at NetApp left the team,
there would be others in the team that I can work with. 
I signed the offer to join ATG.

Things started to develop in the opposite direction I was hoping to see.

* In July 2015, both of my two mentors left ATG. 
I was shocked, as I was scheduled to join ATG in the next month. 
* Then, 2 months (Oct. 2015) after I joined the team, another engineer left ATG.
* 3 months later (Jan. 2016), yet another engineer left ATG.
* 3 months later (April 2016) came the brutal layoff: two engineers and my manager were let go.

During my first nine month since joining ATG, 
6 engineers and 1 manager left the team. We were left with a team of 4 engineers, including myself.

We were able to recruite a new team member in May 2017. 
Then another engineer left ATG in Dec 2017. I have been working with this engineer for a while
and really enjoyed working with him. We returned to a 4-person team.

Sometime in 2018, our VP was moved to be part of a product team. 
He took away a few guys from ATG, including one engineer from our site.
We were at a 3-person team!

In Sep. 2018, NetApp recruited a new CSO (Chief Strategy Officer) and ATG was moved to be
under CSO's org. 

The recently joined engineer was recruited to join Google in Jan 2019. 
Alright, 2-person team now! 
On the other hand, we looked forward to the summer when a new PhD student would join us.
He did an internship with us in 2018 and accepted our return offer.

The PhD student joined us in June 2019. We were back at a 3-person team and 
this stayed for a while until Jan 2020 when another engineer left the team. 
We were back into a 2-person team. 

On August 25 2020, during my regular bi-weekly 1x1 with my manager, I was informed 
my position was eleminated and ATG was disbanded.
