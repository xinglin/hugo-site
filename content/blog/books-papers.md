## Papers

There are some papers that are so well written that I really enjoyed reading
them. Here is a list of them.

6. Optimizing Space Amplification in RocksDB  

    *This paper provides a great introduction on LSM-tree, how RocksDB is used as the storage engine for 
    MySQL and some statistics of three LSM-tree based systems used in production in Facebook.*

5. BlueCache: A Scalable Distributed Flash-based Key-value Store

    *The system design is very clear from the paper. Learned a lot about 
    its index and data store part.*

4. What's Really New with NewSQL?  

    *Provides a historial view of how we enter into NewSQL and did an excellent survey of state-of-art NewSQL Databases*  

2. NV-Tree: Reducing Consistency Cost for NVM-based Single Level Systems  

    *Excellent analysis of overhead in keeping B+ tree consistent, followed by
    a clear presentation of the proposed solution.*  

3. The Multi-Queue Replacement Algorithm for Second Level Buffer Caches  

    *Excellent analysis of re-use distance in second-level cache, to motivate their cache design*

1. CAFTL: A Content-Aware Flash Translation Layer Enhancing the Lifespan of Flash Memory based Solid State Drives
